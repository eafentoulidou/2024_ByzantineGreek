## Description
This model is based on a transcription of Cod. Parisinus gr. 1382 [Paris Bibliothèque nationale de France, Grec 1382 (diktyon: 50997), 14th c.]. 
Some of the basic rules for the transcription are:
• The orthography of the manuscript is not normalised. Mistakes are not corrected; however, they are tagged as such and the corrected spelling has been provided.
• Marginal notes (added by a later hand) have been transcribed and they have been separated into different text regions.
• Iota subscriptum is not present in the main text of the manuscript; however, it has been added to the transcription.
• Punctuation: comma has been kept; upper dot (·) has been kept; whereas, full-stop/ period (.) is used to mark the end of a whole text entity (paragraphs, titles), which in the manuscript is indicated as .
• Abbreviations are tagged as such and they have been expanded in the transcription.
• Capitalisation: the rules of G. W. H. Lampe. A Patristic Greek Lexicon (Oxford, 1961) have been followed.
